			<h2>Expertise</h2>
			<p>Does your current set-up give you headaches?  Always running behind your gear to shuffle wires?  Do you want to incorporate the latest technology, but not sure how to fit it in?  Plagued by crashes or equipment failures?  Does the set-up in your conference room just not feel right?  Need help planning a new room or facility?  Or, do you just need a great price on something?  Give us a call!</p>
			<h2>Service</h2>
			<p>Let's face it.  Most of the items we sell can be purchased from hundreds of different sources these days.  What we are selling is service:  Service to help you decide what type of system you need for your business to succeed.  Service to give you fair prices, faithful support, and assistance when acquiring the technology.  A smart engineer to build a reliable and user friendly system.  Fast, efficient, meticulous technicians to install and maintain it.  Knowledgeable sales people to keep you informed of the latest technology trends and solutions.</p>

			<h2>Our Philosophy: think small!</h2>
			<p>Are you sick and tired of large companies with multitudes of layers of managers, supervisors, sales people, and the like?  We are!  When you call Z Systems, you will be talking to sales people who are engineers, technicians who are editors.  The hierarchy is minimized, to maximize the personalized experience.  Yes, we have voicemail, but if you have to leave a message, you are going to get a quick call back.</p>
